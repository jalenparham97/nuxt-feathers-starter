> A Nuxt with Feathers starter template

## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com), an open source web framework for building modern real-time applications and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), a progressive framework based on Vue.js to create modern web applications.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

   ```
   cd path/to/nuxt-feathers
   npm install
   ```

3. Start your app

   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli          # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
